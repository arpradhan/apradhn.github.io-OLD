<p>
I was bitten by the programming bug in my senior of college after contributing to an Arduino-based light installation to my New Media professorâ€™s mobile sauna/performance space that pulsated in reaction to temperature shifts. I taught myself enough HTML and CSS during that project to find employment as a Web Designer, and began taking night classes in PHP and JavaScript, until arriving at Flatiron to build full stack web applications with Ruby on Rails and SQLite. Not one to sit idle, I enjoy developing personal projects outside of
work that allow me to experiment with APIs and software design patterns I would otherwise not get a chance to use, e.g. AJAX, recursive loops, regular expressions. As an avid New York Times crossword solver with a Liberal Arts background, I enjoy the limitless amounts of intellectual engagement and creative expression that software design affords.
